1. can a single device act as a server as well as provisioner ?
2. how client devices can subscribe to server last onoff status ?


**Things to try out**

1. If user want to control server from android app ?
   1.1. can we integrate onoff client, onoff server model in the same node together with WiFi coexist.
   1.2. through WiFi it will connect to server and get app input and using client it will set on/off.
